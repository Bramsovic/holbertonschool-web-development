# 🎨 CSS Advanced — Holberton School

> A front-end styling project based on a Figma design, focused on clean and accurate CSS integration.

## 🚀 Objectives

This project is a **continuation of the HTML, advanced project**. All previous HTML tasks must be completed before starting this one.

Your main goal is to **replicate a web page layout and design based on a provided Figma file**, using clean and organized CSS. Precision, structure, and simplicity are key.

### You will:

- Style a full HTML page based on a professional Figma design
- Use accurate measurements, spacing, fonts, and colors
- Keep CSS selectors simple and reusable
- Organize your stylesheet cleanly
- Deploy your final result on **GitHub Pages**
